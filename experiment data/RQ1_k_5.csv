","Fallacy Name: ambiguity
Definition: You used a double meaning or ambiguity of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth.
Example: When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there.
Background: Politicians are often guilty of using ambiguity to mislead and will later point to how they were technically not outright lying if they come under scrutiny. The reason that it qualifies as a fallacy is that it is intrinsically&nbsp;misleading.

"Users want to get weekly economic indicators and display listings of rental properties in specific cities and states in the United States. First collect weekly data, analyze recent trends, and filter attributes based on the results. For example, if weekly data shows a decline in economic indicators, focus on properties below a certain price threshold; If the economic indicators are stable, we can consider widening the price range. Users can specify locations by city and state to screen and recommend relevant rental properties based on the latest economic trends.","import requests

"Develop a houseplant exploration service to help users browse different categories of houseplants, especially ferns. Users can view a list of all available plant categories, select a category and get detailed information about ferns in it (including common names, pictures, and climate adaptations). In addition, the service also provides a general overview of houseplants, showing basic information such as classification, scientific name and growing region, so that users can have a more comprehensive understanding of various houseplants.","import requests

Description  : If you need a light breakfast or you simply want a drinkable treat, this coconut chai smoothie recip...
Prepare Time : 15 minutes

Ingredients  :
  - Almond Milk, Vanilla Or Other Flavors, Unsweetened: 2 cup (2.0g)
  - Spiced Chai Tea Bags by Trader Joe's: 1 bag (1.0g)
  - Frozen Coconut Chunks By Trader Joe's: 1 ounce (1.0g)

Steps        :
  1. Heat the almond milk over the stove to a strong simmer. Steep the chai tea in the almond milk for 5-10 minutes, depending on how strong you want the flavor to be. After the milk has steeped, discard the tea bag and store the milk in the freezer until it becomes cold.
  2. For the coconut, cut it into cubes if necessary. The coconut must be frozen for this recipe, so have this prepare in advance. When the almond milk is cold, blend it with the frozen coconut cubes.
  3. You may refrigerate your smoothie for a thicker consistency before consuming. Pour it in a tall glass. Enjoy !

Synopsis: After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality. Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor.

The brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy, Winry creates prosthetic limbs for Edward by utilizing ""automail,"" a tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. After years of training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange.

As Edward becomes an infamous alchemist and gains the nickname ""Fullmetal,"" the boys' journey embroils them in a growing conspiracy that threatens the fate of the world.

With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.

Title: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
Ranking: 2
Episodes: 64
Status: Finished Airing
Synopsis: After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality. Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor.

The brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy, Winry creates prosthetic limbs for Edward by utilizing ""automail,"" a tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. After years of training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange.

As Edward becomes an infamous alchemist and gains the nickname ""Fullmetal,"" the boys' journey embroils them in a growing conspiracy that threatens the fate of the world.

Title: Hunter x Hunter (2011)
Ranking: 8
Episodes: 148
Status: Finished Airing
Synopsis: Hunters devote themselves to accomplishing hazardous tasks, all from traversing the world's uncharted territories to locating rare items and monsters. Before becoming a Hunter, one must pass the Hunter Examination—a high-risk selection process in which most applicants end up handicapped or worse, deceased.

Ambitious participants who challenge the notorious exam carry their own reason. What drives 12-year-old Gon Freecss is finding Ging, his father and a Hunter himself. Believing that he will meet his father by becoming a Hunter, Gon takes the first step to walk the same path.

During the Hunter Examination, Gon befriends the medical student Leorio Paladiknight, the vindictive Kurapika, and ex-assassin Killua Zoldyck. While their motives vastly differ from each other, they band together for a common goal and begin to venture into a perilous world.
